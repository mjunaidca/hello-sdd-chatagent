# Feature Specification: Responsive Chat Interface

**Feature Branch**: `002-user-lands-on`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "User lands on /chat ‚Üí sees responsive chat window. Can type messages in input, hit enter/send ‚Üí message appears instantly in bubble. Assistant responds via /chat/streaming SSE ‚Üí token-by-token typing effect. Errors (500/network) show inline in chat, not console-only. Works smoothly on desktop + mobile. Clear entry/exit animations for new messages."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-27
- Q: How should streaming responses be visually presented to users? ‚Üí A: Typing indicator bubble (shows "Assistant is typing..." with animated dots)
- Q: When streaming disconnects, how should reconnection be handled? ‚Üí A: Both automatic retry + manual retry option
- Q: How should message history be presented to users? ‚Üí A: Auto-scroll with pause on user scroll up
- Q: What level of session persistence should be implemented in v1? ‚Üí A: Server-side session storage (persists across devices)
- Q: How should long messages be handled? ‚Üí A: No limit, auto-wrap display

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user visits the chat page and experiences a smooth, responsive conversation interface where they can send messages and receive real-time responses with visual feedback and error handling.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user visits `/chat`, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see a responsive chat window that adapts to their screen size
2. **Given** a user is on the chat page, **When** they type a message and press enter or click send, **Then** their message appears instantly in a chat bubble
3. **Given** a user sends a message, **When** the assistant responds, **Then** they see a typing indicator bubble with animated dots, followed by the complete response
4. **Given** a user is chatting, **When** a network error or server error occurs, **Then** they see an error message inline in the chat with automatic retry and manual retry option
5. **Given** a user is on mobile or desktop, **When** they interact with the chat, **Then** the interface works smoothly on both platforms
6. **Given** new messages appear, **When** they are displayed, **Then** they have clear entry and exit animations

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the user sends a very long message? (System auto-wraps display with no character limits)
- How does the system handle rapid message sending?
- What happens when the assistant response is interrupted or fails mid-stream? (Automatic retry with manual retry option)
- How does the interface behave when the user switches between mobile and desktop views?
- What happens when the user tries to send a message while another is being processed?
- How does the chat history behave when user scrolls up? (Auto-scroll pauses, resumes when user scrolls to bottom)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a responsive chat window when users visit `/chat`
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to type messages in an input field
- **FR-003**: System MUST support both Enter key and Send button for message submission
- **FR-004**: System MUST display user messages instantly in chat bubbles upon sending
- **FR-005**: System MUST display assistant responses with typing indicator bubble (animated dots) followed by complete response
- **FR-006**: System MUST show error messages inline in the chat interface with automatic retry and manual retry option
- **FR-007**: System MUST work smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide clear entry and exit animations for new messages
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain chat history with auto-scroll to bottom (pauses when user scrolls up)
- **FR-011**: System MUST persist chat sessions server-side across device switches
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle messages of any length with auto-wrap display
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle message input validation and provide user feedback

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Chat Message**: Represents a single message in the conversation with content, timestamp, sender type (user/assistant), and status
- **Chat Session**: Represents the current conversation state with message history, user context, and server-side persistence across devices

### UX Requirements *(include if feature involves user interface)*
- **Mobile-First Design**: Interface MUST be designed mobile-first with responsive breakpoints
- **Accessibility**: Interface MUST meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- **Design System**: Use shadcn/ui components for consistent design patterns
- **Animations**: Smooth, purposeful animations for state transitions and user feedback
- **User Testing**: Real UX flows MUST be established before placeholder test generation
