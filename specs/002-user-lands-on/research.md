# Research: Responsive Chat Interface

**Feature**: 002-user-lands-on  
**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Context**: Next.js 15 chat interface with real-time streaming

## Technology Decisions

### Next.js 15 with App Router
**Decision**: Use Next.js 15 with App Router for the chat interface  
**Rationale**: 
- Latest stable version with improved performance and developer experience
- App Router provides better file-based routing and layout system
- Built-in TypeScript support and excellent developer tooling
- Server-side rendering capabilities for better SEO and performance
- Native support for streaming and real-time features

**Alternatives considered**:
- React with Vite: Less opinionated but requires more configuration
- Remix: Good for forms but less suitable for real-time chat
- SvelteKit: Different paradigm, team familiarity with React

### Tailwind CSS for Styling
**Decision**: Use Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling  
**Rationale**:
- Rapid development with utility classes
- Consistent design system with built-in responsive breakpoints
- Excellent mobile-first approach
- Great integration with Next.js and ShadCN/ui
- Small bundle size with purging

**Alternatives considered**:
- Styled Components: Runtime overhead, more complex setup
- CSS Modules: More verbose, less consistent
- Emotion: Similar to styled-components, runtime overhead

### ShadCN/ui Component Library
**Decision**: Use ShadCN/ui for consistent component design  
**Rationale**:
- Copy-paste components (no runtime dependencies)
- Built on Radix UI primitives for accessibility
- Excellent TypeScript support
- Customizable with Tailwind CSS
- Mobile-first responsive design
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance out of the box

**Alternatives considered**:
- Material-UI: Heavier bundle, less customizable
- Chakra UI: Good but different design language
- Headless UI: More work to implement design system

### Framer Motion for Animations
**Decision**: Use Framer Motion for smooth animations and transitions  
**Rationale**:
- Declarative animation API
- Excellent performance with hardware acceleration
- Great TypeScript support
- Perfect for chat bubble animations and typing indicators
- Small bundle size with tree shaking
- Easy to implement complex animations

**Alternatives considered**:
- React Spring: More complex API, steeper learning curve
- CSS animations: Less flexible, harder to orchestrate
- Lottie: Overkill for simple UI animations

### Server-Sent Events (SSE) for Streaming
**Decision**: Use SSE for real-time message streaming  
**Rationale**:
- Native browser support, no additional libraries needed
- Perfect for one-way streaming (server to client)
- Automatic reconnection handling
- Lightweight compared to WebSockets
- Works well with Next.js API routes
- Easy to implement typing indicators

**Alternatives considered**:
- WebSockets: Overkill for one-way streaming, more complex
- Polling: Inefficient, not real-time
- WebRTC: Too complex for simple chat

### Server-Side Session Storage
**Decision**: Use Redis for session storage with PostgreSQL for persistence  
**Rationale**:
- Redis provides fast in-memory session storage
- PostgreSQL for persistent chat history
- Cross-device session sharing
- Scalable architecture
- Easy to implement with Next.js API routes

**Alternatives considered**:
- Browser localStorage: Not cross-device, limited storage
- In-memory only: Lost on server restart
- Database-only: Slower for frequent reads

## Implementation Patterns

### Mobile-First Responsive Design
**Pattern**: Design for mobile first, then enhance for desktop  
**Implementation**:
- Use Tailwind's mobile-first breakpoints (sm:, md:, lg:)
- Touch-friendly button sizes (min 44px)
- Optimized for thumb navigation
- Progressive enhancement for desktop features

### Auto-Scroll with Pause Behavior
**Pattern**: Auto-scroll to bottom, pause when user scrolls up  
**Implementation**:
- Track scroll position and user scroll events
- Use Intersection Observer for scroll detection
- Resume auto-scroll when user reaches bottom
- Smooth scrolling with CSS scroll-behavior

### Typing Indicator Animation
**Pattern**: Animated dots while waiting for response  
**Implementation**:
- CSS keyframes for dot animation
- Framer Motion for smooth transitions
- Show/hide based on streaming state
- Accessible with proper ARIA labels

### Error Recovery with Retry
**Pattern**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff + manual retry  
**Implementation**:
- Exponential backoff for automatic retries (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s)
- Manual retry button for user control
- Clear error messages with retry status
- Graceful degradation when retries fail

## Performance Considerations

### Bundle Size Optimization
- Tree shaking for Framer Motion
- Dynamic imports for heavy components
- Image optimization with Next.js Image component
- CSS purging with Tailwind

### Streaming Performance
- Chunked responses for large messages
- Debounced typing indicators
- Efficient re-rendering with React.memo
- Virtual scrolling for long chat histories

### Mobile Performance
- Touch event optimization
- Reduced motion for accessibility
- Efficient scroll handling
- Battery-conscious animations

## Accessibility Requirements

### WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance
- Proper ARIA labels for all interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast ratios
- Focus management

### Mobile Accessibility
- Touch target sizes (min 44px)
- Voice control support
- Reduced motion preferences
- High contrast mode support

## Security Considerations

### Input Sanitization
- XSS prevention for user messages
- Proper escaping of user content
- Content Security Policy headers

### Session Security
- Secure session tokens
- HTTPS only for production
- Session timeout handling
- CSRF protection

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Jest + React Testing Library for components
- Hook testing for useChatStream
- Utility function testing
- Mock SSE connections

### E2E Testing
- Playwright for full user flows
- Mobile and desktop viewport testing
- Streaming behavior validation
- Error recovery testing

### Performance Testing
- Lighthouse audits
- Bundle size monitoring
- Animation performance testing
- Mobile device testing
