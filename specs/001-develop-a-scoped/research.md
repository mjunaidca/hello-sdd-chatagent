# ChatWait Research Findings

## Streaming Implementation with OpenAI Agents SDK

**Decision**: Use OpenAI Agents SDK's built-in streaming capabilities with FastAPI for SSE delivery.

**Rationale**:
- SDK provides native streaming through `Runner.run_streamed()` with event-driven architecture
- Supports real-time token streaming with automatic delta handling via `ResponseTextDeltaEvent`
- Built-in connection state management and error handling
- Enables <200ms per token latency target with SDK's optimized streaming engine
- Aligns with async-first architecture and leverages SDK's tested streaming components

**Implementation Pattern**:
```python
output = Runner.run_streamed(starting_agent=agent, input=user_message, context=context)
async for event in output.stream_events():
    if event.type == "raw_response_event" and isinstance(event.data, ResponseTextDeltaEvent):
        yield f"data: {{\"token\": \"{event.data.delta}\", \"token_index\": {index}}}"
```

**Alternatives considered**:
- FastAPI EventSourceResponse: Rejected as it bypasses SDK's built-in streaming capabilities
- WebSocket implementation: Rejected due to higher complexity and overhead
- Raw SSE without SDK: Rejected due to lack of integration with agent framework

## OpenAI Agents SDK Integration Patterns

**Decision**: Use OpenAI Agents SDK with stateless agent configuration for v1 implementation.

**Rationale**:
- SDK provides clean abstraction for LLM interactions and conversation orchestration
- Supports session management patterns (e.g., SQLiteSession) for future extensibility
- Enables clean separation between agent logic and API layer as required by constitution
- Supports streaming responses natively which aligns with performance requirements

**Alternatives considered**:
- Direct LLM API calls: Rejected due to lack of conversation orchestration features
- Custom agent framework: Rejected due to development overhead and maintenance concerns
- LangChain integration: Rejected as too heavy for initial stateless implementation

## Chainlit UI Integration for Dual Modes

**Decision**: Use Chainlit's dual interface approach with mode selection for synchronous vs streaming interactions.

**Rationale**:
- Chainlit provides native support for both sync and streaming chat interfaces
- Enables seamless switching between `/chat/wait` and `/chat/streaming` endpoints
- Supports custom UI components for reconnection controls and error handling
- Aligns with clean architecture separation requirements

**Alternatives considered**:
- Custom React/JS frontend: Rejected due to development complexity and maintenance overhead
- Streamlit integration: Rejected as less suitable for real-time streaming interactions
- Custom FastAPI web interface: Rejected due to UI development overhead

## Gemini LLM Configuration via OpenAI-Compatible API

**Decision**: Use AsyncOpenAI client with Gemini's OpenAI-compatible endpoint for seamless SDK integration.

**Rationale**:
- Direct integration with Gemini API through OpenAI-compatible endpoint
- AsyncOpenAI client configured with `base_url="https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai/"`
- OpenAIChatCompletionsModel using "gemini-2.5-flash" model
- SDK automatically handles streaming, context management, and response parsing
- Enables consistent interface while leveraging Gemini's specific capabilities

**Configuration Pattern**:
```python
external_client = AsyncOpenAI(
    api_key=gemini_api_key,
    base_url="https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai/",
)

llm_model = OpenAIChatCompletionsModel(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    openai_client=external_client
)
```

**Alternatives considered**:
- Direct Gemini API integration: Rejected due to SDK compatibility requirements
- OpenAI GPT models: Rejected due to preference for Gemini's capabilities
- Multiple LLM provider support: Rejected for v1 scope, can be added later

## Technical Architecture Alignment

**Decision**: Three-layer architecture with SDK streaming: Chainlit UI → FastAPI API → OpenAI Agents SDK → Gemini LLM.

**Rationale**:
- Clear separation of concerns: UI handles presentation, API manages HTTP layer, SDK handles agent orchestration
- SDK's built-in streaming eliminates need for custom SSE implementation
- Clean data flow: UI → API → SDK Runner → LLM → streaming response
- Leverages SDK's tested streaming engine and event handling
- Maintains extensibility for future enhancements and session management

**Streaming Flow**:
1. FastAPI receives request and calls `Runner.run_streamed()`
2. SDK manages agent execution and LLM interaction
3. Events streamed back through FastAPI SSE endpoint
4. UI receives token-by-token updates via EventSource

**Alternatives considered**:
- Monolithic architecture: Rejected due to constitutional requirements for layer separation
- Custom SSE without SDK: Rejected as it bypasses SDK's built-in streaming capabilities
- Client-side agent logic: Rejected due to security and performance concerns

## Performance and Reliability Considerations

**Decision**: Leverage SDK's built-in performance optimizations and add custom reconnection support.

**Rationale**:
- SDK provides optimized streaming engine with built-in connection management
- AsyncOpenAI client handles connection pooling and retry logic automatically
- SDK's event-driven architecture enables efficient token streaming
- Custom token index tracking for reconnection support (not provided by SDK)
- 5-minute connection timeout prevents resource leaks from abandoned streams

**Streaming Performance**:
- SDK's `ResponseTextDeltaEvent` provides efficient delta-only updates
- Event-driven architecture reduces memory overhead
- Built-in flow control prevents buffer overflow
- <200ms per token latency target supported by SDK's optimized streaming

**Reliability Features**:
- SDK handles LLM API failures and retries automatically
- Built-in error handling with proper exception propagation
- Connection state management prevents resource leaks
- Custom reconnection logic for interrupted streams

**Alternatives considered**:
- Synchronous processing: Rejected due to performance and scalability concerns
- Custom streaming without SDK: Rejected as it duplicates SDK's tested capabilities
- No connection pooling: Rejected due to SDK's built-in optimizations
