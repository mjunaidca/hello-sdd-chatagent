# Feature Specification: ChatWait

**Feature Branch**: `001-develop-a-scoped`
**Created**: 2025-09-26
**Status**: Approved
**Input**: User description: "Develop a scoped chatbot service called 'ChatWait'. It should expose two modes of interaction: 1. /chat/wait endpoint - Client sends a user message and receives a full response once it is completely generated. Used for synchronous request/response style interactions. 2. /chat/streaming endpoint - Supports server-sent events (SSE). Client begins receiving tokens incrementally as they are generated. Must handle retries and reconnections gracefully so that if the connection drops, the user can resume without losing context. Functional Expectations: The chatbot should respond conversationally, supporting multi-turn dialog. It must provide clear error messages if endpoints are misused. The system should be extensible so that future features (like conversation history, user sessions, or integrations) can be layered in without breaking existing functionality. Performance should be acceptable for real-time use: streaming latency must feel natural. User experience must be consistent across both wait and streaming modes. Constraints for this initial specification: No authentication or user management. No persistence of chat history (stateless per request). Focus on proving stable synchronous and streaming interaction paths."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user engages with the ChatWait chatbot service to get conversational responses to their questions and messages, choosing between immediate full responses or streaming responses as needed for their interaction style and context.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has a question they want answered immediately, **When** they send a message to the /chat/wait endpoint, **Then** they receive a complete response after the system has finished generating it entirely.
2. **Given** a user wants to see responses as they are being generated for a more interactive experience, **When** they connect to the /chat/streaming endpoint, **Then** they begin receiving response tokens incrementally as the system generates them.
3. **Given** a user is receiving a streaming response and the connection drops, **When** they reconnect to the /chat/streaming endpoint with the same context, **Then** they can resume receiving the response without losing their place.
4. **Given** a user sends an improperly formatted request to either endpoint, **When** the request is processed, **Then** they receive a clear error message explaining what went wrong and how to correct it.
5. **Given** a user has been chatting with the system across multiple turns, **When** they send a new message that references previous context, **Then** the chatbot responds conversationally taking that context into account.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a streaming connection drops mid-response? The user should be able to reconnect and resume receiving tokens from the last successfully delivered token without losing context.
- How does the system handle very long responses in streaming mode? The connection should remain stable and the user should continue receiving tokens.
- What happens when the wait endpoint receives malformed input? The system should return a JSON error payload with appropriate HTTP status code and user-friendly message without exposing internal implementation details.
- How does the system behave when under high load? Response times should remain reasonable for both endpoints.

### Error Handling
- **Error Response Format**: All endpoints return JSON error responses with `error_code` (string identifier) and `message` (user-friendly description) fields
- **HTTP Status Codes**: Appropriate status codes (400 for bad requests, 500 for server errors, 429 for rate limiting)
- **No Internal Details**: Error messages never expose implementation details, database errors, or stack traces

### Streaming Resilience
- **Connection Recovery**: When streaming connections are interrupted, clients can reconnect and resume from the last successfully received token
- **Token Tracking**: System maintains token sequence numbers to enable precise resumption without duplication or loss
- **Context Preservation**: Conversation context is maintained across reconnection attempts within the same session
- **Timeout Handling**: Abandoned streaming connections are automatically cleaned up after 5 minutes to prevent resource leaks
- **Resource Cleanup**: Server-side resources associated with abandoned connections are released to maintain system stability

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a /chat/wait endpoint that accepts user messages and returns complete responses after generation is finished
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a /chat/streaming endpoint that supports server-sent events and streams response tokens incrementally as they are generated
- **FR-003**: System MUST handle streaming connection drops gracefully, allowing users to reconnect and resume without losing context
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide clear, user-friendly error messages when endpoints are misused or receive invalid input
- **FR-005**: System MUST support conversational multi-turn dialog where responses take previous conversation context into account
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain consistent user experience across both wait and streaming interaction modes
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide acceptable performance for real-time use with streaming latency under 200ms per token to feel natural to users
- **FR-008**: System MUST be designed for extensibility to allow future features to be added without breaking existing functionality
- **FR-011**: System MUST support optional client-managed context for extensibility while maintaining stateless server operation
- **FR-009**: System MUST remain stateless per request with no persistence of chat history
- **FR-010**: System MUST operate without authentication or user management as specified in the initial scope

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Chat Message**: Represents a single user input or system response, containing the message text and timestamp
- **Conversation Context**: Represents the current state of a multi-turn conversation, containing recent message history for context
- **Stream Connection**: Represents an active streaming session between client and server, maintaining connection state for resumption

### Extensibility Strategy
- **Client-Managed Context**: Future session/history features can be implemented by having clients manage and submit conversation context with each request
- **Optional Context Parameter**: Endpoints accept optional context parameters without requiring server-side state management
- **Backward Compatibility**: New parameters are optional and don't break existing client implementations
- **API Versioning**: Future extensions use API versioning to maintain compatibility with existing integrations
